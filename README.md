# Spa_Study_Project
A minimalist spa-themed landing page built with HTML and CSS as part of my front-end learning journey. This project explores layout structure, responsive design, and subtle visual effects — including how to blur images using CSS for ambient styling.

Skills learned:
Semantic HTML structure,
Responsive layout with Flexbox,
CSS image blur using filter: blur(),
Font Awesome integration,
Privacy controls with robots.txt
